# time-tracker-pro

The project involves creating a time card app. This app should allow users to clock in and out, tracking their working hours. It's intended for employees or freelancers who need to manage their work hours or for businesses looking for a simple solution to monitor employees' work times. The app should include functionalities such as user registration and login, a dashboard displaying total hours worked, possibly a weekly or monthly overview, and options for users to manually enter or adjust their work hours if needed. The design should be straightforward and user-friendly, focusing on ease of use.
